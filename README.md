# ReduCycle  
**Turning e-waste into education, one device at a time.**

---

## 🌍 The Problem
- 50 million tonnes of e-waste are generated every year.  
- Less than 20 % is formally recycled.  
- Millions of under-privileged students lack access to basic digital education.

---

## ⚡ The Idea
ReduCycle is a **student-led, zero-profit** movement that:

1. **Collects** discarded laptops, tablets and phones through school & community drives in Dubai.  
2. **Refurbishes** them (data-wiped, repaired, upgraded) with help from local IT volunteers.  
3. **Funds** free digital-literacy courses for under-privileged youth by selling restored devices or parts that can’t be reused.  
4. **Teaches** essential skills (computer basics, productivity tools, internet safety) in peer-to-peer classes run by IB students.  
5. **Certificates** every graduate with a ReduCycle Digital-Literacy Certificate.

## 🥚 Easter Egg
Paste the Konami-code (↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A Enter) while on the site and the light-rays will switch to **rainbow rave mode** for 30 s.  
(If you’re on mobile, just tap the logo 10 times – same deal.)

**We don’t recycle gadgets. We recycle futures.**
